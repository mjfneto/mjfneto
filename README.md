- 👋 Hi, I’m @mjfneto
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development, creating intuitive web interfaces, and exploring new technologies to build high-performance applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and deepening my knowledge in programming through the Santander Tech+ Skill+ program at Ada Tech, focusing on front-end development and data science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that focus on developing functional and performant web applications, and that are aligned with best market practices.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a background in International Relations and have also worked as a kitchen assistant.
